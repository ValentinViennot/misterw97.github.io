    We need to stop fooling ourselves: our regular todo apps will never succeed in managing recurring tasks and are only frustrating us. You set a reminder, it's never the right time, you end up doing it late and feeling bad about it... Even worse: once you mark it done, the next occurrence shows up!    
    The real question is, "how often?" and not "when?". The focus should be on keeping the lights green rather than on doing things on time. Inspired by the popular game "The Sims", we think that the goal of such an app should be to estimate a status for something you cannot easily measure.

    This year I co-founded ThePinkOwl to develop open-source projects for home automation and more generally open-source education. Although not directly related to home automation, "Gauges" will be one of the first products coming out from this project. I'm leading product design.

    In these times of lockdown, it is critical to stay in touch with our friends and family. What's better for that than a great board game? Unfortunately, some of these games can merely be played remotely.    
    We could hijack our traditional messaging apps. But wouldn't it be funnier to focus on the game?    
    The [Bluffer](https://www.trictrac.net/jeu-de-societe/bluffer) is, IMO, one of the most user-friendly and fun games to play. However, it's also one of the hardest to virtualize without specific tools.    
    I took the day off to design and build this quick remote app to play this iconic game with my family. The great time that resulted from this was way worth the work!

    "The near-unlimited choice of items presented in online stores leads users on journeys of
    untargeted and unsatisfying scrolling through bottomless pages on the search for products
    they really like."

    In the context of the EPFL Experience Design course (Fall 2019),
    we proposed both a new -- fun -- way to browse shopping catalogues and a
    powerful background data analysis leveraging a familiar technology: swiping.     
    What if this simple gesture could tell much more about a customer than the
    classic scroll and click combo? What you swipe and How you swipe it.

    We built a working demonstration extracting features from swipe gestures
    to characterize them among other participants and among your usual swipes.
    This demonstration convinced the final presentations jury!

    Have you ever invited vegetarian/vegan friends over for diner and didn't know how to replace the meat in your favorite dish?
    Or had a crucial ingredient suddently disappearing from your kitchen?
    This project is for you!

    In the context of the EPFL Network Tour of Data Science course (Fall 2019),
    we proposed to create a tool to remove certain ingredients from a recipe and output the best ingredients to replace them.
    We used data science and graph manipulation to develop an ingredient suggestion and replacement tool.
    After developping several ingredient networks using the Recipe1M+ and USDA databases,
    we used a combination of nearest neighbors analysis and graph filtering to determine the optimal
    replacements for ingredients.

    We successfully developed palatable choices both for meat-loving and vegan users!
    We were also able to suggest ingredients to add to make your recipes even tastier.

    Junction is "Europe's leading hackathon, yearly gathering around 1500 hackers together [...]
    developers, designers and other techies, teaming up and creating new tech projects in 48 hours". I got a chance to participate in the 2019 edition.

    With my newly-met team, we participated in the [Qoco](https://www.qoco.aero/) challenge: how can you improve the traveler experience with a lugage-tracking real-time API?
    After brainstorming pretty common ideas about creating UIs to track luggages (in fact, that's a big lack today),
    we combined that with Blockchain technology to enforce trust among different parties: traveler, aiport, airline company.

    However, we felt it wasn't innovative enough. Why would we need this trust? Who would benefit from that? Travel insurances.
    In fact, lost luggages are more a matter of fear sentiment than an actual technical problem.
    Overnight, we moved our project to a neo-insurance providing instant help-package and 5-days full refund in case of lost or broken luggage.

    With a friend of mine, we wanted to organize a scientific and technical Hackathon open to all students with no entry fee.
    Therefore, we founded a student NGO -- Hacklyon -- and organised "Alpha" in 2018:
    a small hackathon about bringing AI and Cloud technologies to the transports industry.
    I am really proud of this achievement and the role I played as Event Manager.
    I was leading a team of 7 to organise partnerships, communication, technical resources, event schedule, food and necessities, budgeting...
    We had a great time on day-d with the 50 participants during 34H.
    I am proud of the result as every participant and partner was very satisfied, proud of the quality we delivered --
    being recognised as a Web Conference partner for this event.
    Most of all, I am proud of what we made from almost nothing: having less than 100â‚¬ per participant with no participation fee,
    although food and all required material was on ours! I learned a lot about leadership, organising events... and even technically.

    When I joined the preparatory cycle at INSA Lyon, I was having troubles remembering or just paying attention to the teachers giving us homeworks.
    I observed many former high school students stuggling to have the same understanding of what was just one (often unclear) quick sentence at
    the end of a lecture or an exercise series.
    Almost every day someone had to ask on our Facebook group, "do we need to do anything for tomorrow?".    
    I quickly prototyped a PHP app for what I first called "the collaborative textbook".
    Then, I experimented for the first time with AngularJS and Ionic and evolved it to the Agendapp.
    A classic student agenda, shared among all course students.

    In high school, I was president of the student office with a need for change.
    I lead a huge modernization campaign of our tools (also because I wanted real life projects to learn programming on).
    We needed to manage our business, to interact with the school administration and -- most of all -- as students we needed information.
    Communication is always a major problem in big orgs.
    I built *my first real world* web application divided in 4 "subdomains":
    office administration, school administration, information screens and a public portal.
    Eventually the first TV screen was installed in our high school displaying useful information to students and these IT tools became
    standard use for both the student office and the high school administration.
    Today, I still receive messages about new screens being installed and how useful it is to the school!
