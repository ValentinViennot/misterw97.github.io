    I participated in the InCube Challenge organized by the ETH Zürich. Four days in a cube/hut in the mountain with a team of five people to solve one of the world’s main challenge: making our food system more efficient and sustainable. I learned a lot from this experience, mostly about team leadership, team dynamics, and self-awareness. I also applied Design Thinking successfully to a complex problem.  

    Why is our food system unsustainable and less and less efficient over the years? The root cause can be found in the principal agriculture practice used today: monoculture. It causes soil depletion, requiring more fertilisers over the years. The main problem for shifting from mono to diversified cultures is the access to the market for selling a small amount of food.  
    We propose to apply the smart grid model used for the electricity market: We are interconnecting all smart producers on a predictable and reliable grid, where food can be sold/bought at a market price.  
    We chose a country with many small farmers concerned by this problem today: India. Sadly, India and emerging countries suffer from corruption. We based our solution on blockchain technology to enforce trust among our network with a decentralised food system.  
    Finally, we designed our solution with a single negotiated price among the whole network for an available resource, based on offer/demand and computed every day. We add to that price the transportation and storage costs afterward while matching a buyer with the seller(s), optimizing the supply chain with data-powered algorithms.    
    The best part is that our solution will give a long-term cost-incentive to big producers to shift from monocultures to diversified ones. Indeed, they otherwise wouldn't have enough close buyers on the network to sell their products.    
    We proposed a business model based on a small fee for each transaction made through our client. Long term, we'll offer specialized software making the most of our network's data for buyers, warehouses, and transporters in the supply chain.

    We need to stop fooling ourselves: our regular todo apps will never succeed in managing recurring tasks and are only frustrating us. You set a reminder, it's never the right time, you end up doing it late and feeling bad about it... Even worse: once you mark it done, the next occurrence shows up!    
    The real question is, "how often?" and not "when?". The focus should be on keeping the lights green rather than on doing things on time. Inspired by the popular game "The Sims", we think that the goal of such an app should be to estimate a status for something you cannot easily measure.

    This year I co-founded ThePinkOwl to develop open-source projects for home automation and more generally open-source education. Although not directly related to home automation, "Gauges" will be one of the first products coming out from this project. I'm leading product design.

    In these times of lockdown, it is critical to stay in touch with our friends and family. What's better for that than a great board game? Unfortunately, some of these games can merely be played remotely.    
    We could hijack our traditional messaging apps. But wouldn't it be funnier to focus on the game?    
    The [Bluffer](https://www.trictrac.net/jeu-de-societe/bluffer) is, IMO, one of the most user-friendly and fun games to play. However, it's also one of the hardest to virtualize without specific tools.    
    I took the day off to design and build this quick remote app to play this iconic game with my family. The great time that resulted from this was way worth the work!

    "The near-unlimited choice of items presented in online stores leads users on journeys of untargeted and unsatisfying scrolling through bottomless pages on the search for products they like."

    In the context of the EPFL Experience Design course (Fall 2019), we proposed both a new -- fun -- way to browse shopping catalogs and a robust background data analysis leveraging a familiar technology: swiping.    
    What if this simple gesture could tell much more about a customer than the classic scroll and click combo? What you swipe and How you swipe it.

    We built a working demonstration extracting features from swipe gestures to characterize them among other participants and your usual swipes. This demonstration convinced the final presentations jury!

    Have you ever invited vegetarian/vegan friends over for diner and didn't know how to replace the meat in your favorite dish? Or had a crucial ingredient suddenly disappearing from your kitchen?    
    This project is for you!    

    In the context of the EPFL Network Tour of Data Science course (Fall 2019), we proposed to create a tool to remove certain ingredients from a recipe and output the best elements to replace them.    
    We used data science and graph manipulation to develop an ingredient suggestion and replacement tool. After developing several ingredient networks using the Recipe1M+ and USDA databases, we used a combination of kNN analysis and graph filtering to determine the optimal replacements for ingredients.    

    We successfully developed palatable choices both for meat-loving and vegan users! We were also able to suggest ingredients to add to make your recipes even tastier.

    Junction is “Europe’s leading hackathon, yearly gathering around 1500 hackers together […] developers, designers, and other techies, teaming up and creating new tech projects in 48 hours”. I got a chance to participate in the 2019 edition.    

    With my newly-met team, we participated in the [Qoco](https://www.qoco.aero/) challenge: how can you improve the traveler experience with a real-time luggage-tracking API?    
    We first brainstormed pretty standard ideas about creating informative UIs to track luggage (which is a significant lack today). We combined that with Blockchain technology to enforce trust among different parties: traveler, airport, and airline company.    

    I felt it wasn’t an innovative enough project. Why would we need this trust? Who would benefit from that? Travel insurances. Lost luggage is more a matter of fear sentiment than an actual technical problem.    
    Overnight, we moved our project to a neo-insurance providing instant help-package and 5-days full refund in case of lost or broken luggage.

    A year after having been introduced to hackathons by a friend, I wanted to share this amazing experience with others. Together, we decided to organize a scientific and technical Hackathon open to all students with no entry fee. Therefore, we founded an association – Hacklyon – and held “Alpha” in 2018: a hackathon about bringing AI and Cloud technologies to the transports industry.    

    I am proud of this achievement and the role I played as the Event Manager. I was leading a team of 7 to organize partnerships, communication, technical resources, event schedule, food and necessities, and budgeting. We had an enriching and entertaining time on day-d with over 50 participants, during 34H. With less than 100€/participant and no participation fee, we managed to provide all the food and required materials!    

    We were able to measure the success of our event from the positive feedback we obtained from partners and participants. Being part of The Web Conference was a significant recognition of the quality of our organization, communication, and delivery. As a person, I learned a lot about leadership, organizing events, and even technically.

    During my apprenticeship at IBM, I had the opportunity to join the London Garage team as a two-month mobility project. The IBM Cloud Garage is running Design Thinking workshops and developing MVP (Minimum Viable Products), working directly with the client applying agile principles and methodology.    
      
    The London team has many internal projects to develop new skills and try out new technologies/frameworks. One central project was the "pipeline dashboard," showing data about CI/CD configured on the different projects. This project was forked from quite an old framework and needed new integrations. Additionally, we wanted to try Vue.JS before using it on external projects.    
    I proposed to re-design the dashboard, both UI and architecture. After getting advice from the lead designer and an architect from our team, I prototyped and developed a new working dashboard based on a microservices architecture.    
    The team was delighted with the new solution. I even had time to integrate it into another internal project, an IoT alert system.

    Wavestone "Hack your bot" was the first Hackathon I ever participated in.    
    The challenge was to ideate and prototype an enterprise chatbot designed to help internal HR procedures. I came to this Hackathon with two friends from my engineering school, and we teamed up with three Wavestone consultants. Our idea was to design a chatbot helping new employees find their way in the company.

    I proposed an innovative "multi-bot" architecture (cf. diagram above) to improve the pertinence of themed answers. The core idea was to have not one but multiple chatbots answering the user message. The best answer relative to the confidence and the current context would be selected. We also implemented a robust backend to share conversation contexts and progress between multiple bots.

    For this solution, our team won the "Technical Prize," and our solution was described as "state-of-the-art" by the Jury!

    When I joined the preparatory cycle at INSA Lyon, I was having trouble remembering or just paying attention to the teachers giving us homework.    
    I observed many former high school students having the same issue. While assignments were pretty clear in high school, they were just one quick sentence, often unclear, at the end of a lecture or an exercise series in University. Almost every day, someone had to ask on our Facebook group, "do we need to do anything for tomorrow?".    

    I quickly prototyped a PHP app for what I first called "the collaborative textbook." Then, I experimented for the first time with AngularJS and Ionic and evolved it to the Agendapp product. A classic student agenda shared among all course students.    

    The Agendapp made the first uni years easier for all my group and, later, my promotion.

    When I was in high school, I was president of the student office with a desire for change. I led a vast modernization campaign of our tools (also because I wanted real-life projects to learn to program on).    
    We needed to manage our business, interact with the school administration, and -- most of all -- we needed communication tools. Communication is always a significant problem in big organizations.

    I built *my first real-world* web application divided into 4 “subdomains”: office administration, school administration, information screens, and a public portal. Eventually, we installed the first TV screen in our high school, displaying useful information to students.

    These IT tools became regular use for both the student office and the high school administration. Today, I still receive messages about new screens being installed and how useful it is to the school!
