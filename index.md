# About Me

I will graduate from college with a Master degree in [Communication Systems](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/fr/formation/telecommunications-services-usages) in September, 2020. I've been working with Cloud technologies as a full-stack software engineer at the [IBM Garage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/careers) as part of my 3-year apprenticeship.    
I'm looking for the Product Manager job that will put my creativity, leadership and engineering to work.

3 Negative qualities/default: 
- Time Management -- If time management is your weakness, then you can say that you’re controlling it by using reminders, alarms and calendars on digital devices you have.
- Getting Stressed Around Deadlines -- While it’s reasonable to worry a bit because of an approaching deadline, getting too worked up about them can be seen as a negative. You can say that you’re battling this issue by setting reasonable deadlines instead of ambitious ones like you used to.
- Being Too Critical of Yourself -- Maybe you’ve been too critical of yourself, especially in the beginning of your professional career — generating too much negativity can definitely be seen as a weakness. But today, you choose to actively pause and celebrate your accomplishments, which helps with self-esteem

My worst idea?
"So many, but it always learn you something." : find one

## Bio
[See my full resume on LinkedIn]({{ site.linkedin }})

I've always wanted to be an inventor. Since I was a child, I wanted to solve all the problems with my ideas -- often causing my parents and sisters to yell at me, until they eventually told me: "Valentin, you need to be an engineer". Was that the word for an inventor? Without any doubt, I joined the top-ranked INSA de Lyon engineering school right after graduating from High School.

Learning how to code for some side-projects, I quickly realized it was the perfect way to bring all my inventions to life. More than that, programming isn't related to only one field and neither were my ideas.

As I couldn't wait any longer, I started to send applications to different companies to join the Master of IT and Communication Systems in apprenticeship!

That's how I joined IBM in 2017 for my apprenticeship as a full-stack engineer.
Working there I realized two main things:
- not only IT is part of any business, but it's disrupting all of them
- design, and most importantly user-centred design, is core to innovation and building new ideas

I needed to leave my engineer bubble. I spent one semester at the EPFL with two goals: understanding user experience and acquiring knowledge about analytics and data science. Not only did I succeed in both while leading creative projects, but also came back with a new mindset: entrepreneur is the right word for inventor!

All in all, I'm sure about my next step: I want to be a product manager – the CEO of the product. If you're looking for an inventor who's passionate, curious and motivated to learn; not only a thinker but a maker... let's chat and see how we are going to improve our world together!

*"Willing to think, Curious to learn, Enthusiastic about making" is my motto.*
